I worked in the web development industry for more than 10 years and am familiar with all aspects of a
website/app development cycle, from initial analysis and planning, creating wireframes to production
deployment.

Have strong JavaScript, Vue.js, REST, CSS/SCSS, and HTML5 skills. For the last several years gained comprehensive
experience with Laravel and PHP in general and worked on many Laravel+Vue.js/Nuxt.js projects as a Lead
developer. Have vast experience with React.js, MySQL, WordPress, Opencart, and Electron.js.

Feel confident working with technologies like Git, Docker, Figma, Jira / ClickUp, Slack, etc.

Always seeking skill improvement and better practices.
