ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Slava Trofimov, a Full Stack Developer from Toronto.

I'm working in the web development industry for more than 12 years and am familiar with all aspects
of a website/app development cycle, from initial analysis and planning, creating wireframes to
production deployment.

I have strong JavaScript, Vue.js, REST, CSS/SCSS, and HTML5 skills. For the last several years I've
gained wide experience with Laravel and PHP in general and worked on many Laravel+Vue.js/Nuxt.js
projects as a Lead developer.
